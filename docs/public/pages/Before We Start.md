**Auburnsummer**'s custom level repository. most of Rhythm Doctor's custom levels are here instead of the Workshop. here, artists that are not verified can also be used. You probably want to upload here.

in order to upload to Auburnsummer, you need to join the official RD discord server, **Rhythm Doctor Lounge**. uplaod your exported level on *#rd-showcase* and it will be automatically uploaded.

Playing other's levels and seeing how others did them are great learning. **RDL Setlists** provides hundreds of high-quality levels hand-picked for your experience.

There are more basic resources, I will link them when the time is right- because the other's are specific to certain parts of editors.
