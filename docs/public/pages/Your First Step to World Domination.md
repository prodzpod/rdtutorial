Welcome to prod's **RD Editor Tutorial**. no fancy names, straight to the point.  
Just like the name suggests, we cut all the stuff, and will focus on kickstarting you into being a good creator.  

I will also link you to various external sources you can look at, so if you want some in-depth studies or more qualified opinions, check those links out. they're good, I assure you.

Keep in mind that at the time of writing this, I made a total of **1** level. so you might want to get more opinion about some of the less clear cut stuff.

This tutorial is made for **Rhythm Doctor Early Access, r19 Editor**, so free editors might be unable to do some of the more technical stuffs, and the document might miss some of the effects as the editor updates.

Now with that out of the way, let's begin.  
(There will be more pictures and less words on the actual tutorial.)
