Now, enough looking at black screen, let's try clicking on this "plus".

Boom! a samurai. you might get someone else.  
There's a lot of options on the left side, but let's ignore that for now, and press "play".

...a samurai! We successfully created a row. that horizontal line? that's a row.  
Now, the play button does not reset the game, try resetting it by clicking on the light gray area here.

You'll see the game starting from the start of each measure *(outlined area is measure 1, denoted by the number)*, and this is called **scrubbing**. you'll do this a *lot* when making levels.

If you don't see anything, try scrubbing!

Now, there's still no music... let's try adding one!
