Boom! a samurai. you might get someone else.  
There's a lot of options on the left side, but let's ignore that for now, and press "play".

...a samurai! We successfully created a row. that horizontal line? that's a row.  
Now, the play button does not reset the game, try resetting it by clicking on the light gray area here.

You'll see the game starting from the start of each measure *(outlined area is measure 1, denoted by the number)*, and this is called <b style="--d:0">s</b><b style="--d:1">c</b><b style="--d:2">r</b><b style="--d:3">u</b><b style="--d:4">b</b><b style="--d:5">b</b><b style="--d:6">i</b><b style="--d:7">n</b><b style="--d:8">g</b>. you'll do this a *lot* when making levels.

Woah! a pulse! there's gameplay. the stuff you see below directly correspond to the stuff above.  
Each green bar (you see it when you <b style="--d:0">h</b><b style="--d:1">o</b><b style="--d:2">v</b><b style="--d:3">e</b><b style="--d:4">r</b><b style="--d:5"> </b><b style="--d:6">o</b><b style="--d:7">n</b><b style="--d:8"> </b><b style="--d:9">t</b><b style="--d:10">h</b><b style="--d:11">e</b><b style="--d:12"> </b><b style="--d:13">b</b><b style="--d:14">l</b><b style="--d:15">u</b><b style="--d:16">e</b><b style="--d:17"> </b><b style="--d:18">p</b><b style="--d:19">a</b><b style="--d:20">r</b><b style="--d:21">t</b>) represents a tick, and each yellow bar represents where you're supposed to hit.  
If you don't see anything, try scrubbing!
