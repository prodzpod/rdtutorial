## Meta
**Rhythm Doctor** (**RD**)  
Game you're playing.

**Rhythm Doctor Lounge** (**RDL**)  
Official discord server for RD.

**A Dance of Fire and Ice** (**ADOFAI**)  
Another game from the same company. if people compare your level to this, it means the gameplay feels spammy.

**Level**  
Your custom... well, level. It's called "level" in this game, but people will understand you if you say "map" or "customs" as well.

**Chart**  
Can be interchangable with #[Level], but mostly refer to #[Gameplay] exclusively.

**Difficulty Curve**  
Increase or decrease in difficulty over the course of the level. refer to [[Difficulty Curve]].

**Sightread**  
Playing the level first time, without knowing the music. **Sightread Friendly** means it feels fair for first time players, and generally seen as good level design.

**Blind Friendly**  
Playing the level without seeing. #[RD] is an audio game- therefore its generally good for a level to be unambiguous even without any #[Visual] #[Cue]s.

**.rdzip**  
RDZips are the file extension your level should be in. sometimes it's used to describe levels.

**Showcase** / **Workshop**  
#[RD]'s most custom levels are not in the Steam Workshop, instead, it is stored in the **#rd-showcase** channel within #[RDL], and can be accessed outside the discord server by [Auburnsummer's Website](https://auburnsummer.github.io/rdlevels/).

## General
**BPM**  
Beats Per Minute. how fast a song is. tempo.

**Offset**  
Actual starting position of the song, *ms* stands for Millisecond (0.001 second).

Short for syncronization. if the #[BPM] and #[Offset] you set is appropriate, the music and gameplay should be in sync.
